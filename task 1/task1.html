	and all the  other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <i>On The Road.</i> it had been molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>

	<p> She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaimimg that 'work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do'. Although many considerded her pioneering work, unravelling the secrets of the llana <acronym title= 'Deoxyribonucleic Acid' >DNA</acronym> to be an outstanding achievement, Molly did think she had something better to do.</p>
